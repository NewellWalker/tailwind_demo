                A Mars rover is a remote-controlled motor vehicle designed to travel on the surface of Mars. Rovers have several advantages over
                stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny
                positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control. They
                serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A more recent development is the Mars helicopter.
