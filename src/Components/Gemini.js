                The Bridge to the Moonâ€¦ The Gemini program was designed as a bridge between the Mercury and Apollo programs, primarily
                to test equipment and mission procedures in Earth orbit and to train astronauts and ground crews for future Apollo missions.

            In April 1964 and January 1965, two Gemini missions were flown without crews to test systems and the heat shield. These were 
            followed by 10 flights with crews in 1965 and 1966. All were launched by Titan II launch vehicles.
