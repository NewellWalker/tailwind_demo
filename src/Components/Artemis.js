                The Artemis program is a Moon exploration program that is led by the United States' NASA and was formally established in
                2017 via Space Policy Directive 1. The Artemis program is intended to reestablish a human presence on the Moon for the first time
                since Apollo 17 in 1972. The program's stated long-term goal is to establish a permanent base on the Moon to facilitate human missions to Mars.

                Two principal elements of the Artemis program are derived from the now-cancelled Constellation program: the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch
                System (as a reincarnation of Ares V). Other elements of the program, such as the Lunar Gateway space station and the Human Landing System, are
                in development by government space agencies and private spaceflight companies. This collaboration is bound together by the Artemis Accords and
                governmental contracts.
